Abstract
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-2">
<p>AI methods are powerful tools that promise to dramatically change the way we do
science on high performance computational resources. Adoption of these
techniques is growing across many domains, with important use-cases including
analysis of experimental data, acceleration of expensive simulations, and the
control or design of experiments. Meanwhile, the computational costs,
particularly in the area of training deep neural network models, are growing
dramatically as we adopt increasingly large and complex models, tasks, and
datasets. To ensure performant solutions that enable tomorrow&#39;s scientific
discoveries, there is thus a critical need to understand the computational
characteristics and architectural requirements of these emerging workloads and
to drive innovation in the algorithms, software, and hardware stacks. MLPerf
benchmarks from MLCommons have in recent years solidified their position as the
industry-standard measure of AI performance, featuring end-to-end application
benchmarks for both training and inference workloads. More recently, these
efforts have expanded to cover HPC and science AI workloads to address the
aforementioned challenges in scientific AI performance. In this talk I will
discuss MLPerf benchmarks, especially the MLPerf HPC benchmark suite, covering
the methodologies and applications that allow us to characterize AI performance
on large scale HPC systems. I will describe some insights that have already been
learned from this and related efforts, and will conclude with some discussion of
the remaining open challenges in this space and some thoughts on how we might
address them.</p>
