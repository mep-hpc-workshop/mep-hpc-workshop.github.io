Abstract
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
IARPA has initiated a new program, the Advanced Graphic Intelligence Logical
computing Environment (AGILE), to develop innovative, efficient, scalable
computer architecture designs capable of executing next-generation large-scale
data-analytic applications. This effort will require flexible, scalable, and
detailed simulation of the architecture designs to assess the performance,
efficiency, and validity. Data-intensive applications transform massive,
unstructured, heterogeneous data streams into actionable knowledge.</p>
<p>
Today, data is increasing exponentially in volume, velocity, variety, and
complexity. It is often sparse and stored in structures with poor data locality.
The processing needed to ingest, transform, and store data can no longer be
ignored. In many scenarios, they account for a significant fraction of the
overall execution time and consume a substantial portion of machine resources.</p>
<p>
Given the nature of data analytic applications, simplistic benchmarks that
measure individual computations in insolation, without consideration of the
processing required to manage the data – the reorganization and movement of data
between computational components, and the reporting of results – cannot measure
the actual performance and scalability of real-world data-intensive
applications.</p>

Bill Harrod is a program manager at IARPA and he is responsible for the
SuperCables, RAVEN, and AGILE programs. Previously he was the Division Director
for the Department of Energy/Office of Science Advanced Scientific Computing
Research program’s Computational Science Research and Partnerships Division.
Before joining DOE, Bill was a Program Manager in the Information Processing
Technology Office (IPTO) in the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
(DARPA).</p>
<p>
Previously, Bill, who received his PhD in Mathematics from the University of
Tennessee at Knoxville, was a Technology Fellow and then a Principal Engineer at
the National Reconnaissance Office and an Engineering Manager of Computational
and Applied Mathematics at SGI and the Section leader of the Mathematical
Software Group at Cray. While at SGI, he was the developer of the SHMEM (shared
memory) architecture which provided the foundation for one-way communication
libraries used on today’s high performance computers.</p>
